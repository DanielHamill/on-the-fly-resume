    "At Chick-fil-A Supply, we rely heavily on-Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) to shape our technical operations across all Chick-fil-A Vertical Business Lines (entities), including physical distribution centers, food manufacturing facilities, and cloud environments. Our SREs collaborate with DevOps teams to instill SRE principles, set reliability goals, develop tools for operational visibility, and support tailored engineering projects such as big data analytics and high-volume transaction engines. A significant part of our SRE role involves process automation, aiming to minimize manual work across our engineering teams.\n",
